# FightCamp's Take Home Challenge ðŸ¥Š

## 1. Screen Scaling Issue [easy]
To fix the alignment of the data within the packages, I:

1. changed the flex-box on the pricing to be center aligned along with a small margin on the total to no merge with the "or" text.
2. Added a `min-width` on the `packages-block` class to fix an issue with the center block shrinking more than the other two blocks.
3. Added set heights on `.packages-block-header, .packages-block-info` classes to stop the blocks for individually growing inconsistantly. The heights that they are both set to represent a worst-case pixel amount for both classes' heights.

Side note: I originally went with this design for solving the sizing on shrinkage, but ultimatly decided not to commit to the idea.

## 2. Mobile Package Centering [easy]
When the page is shrunk to a mobile size, the blocks do not get centered.

To fix this, I added `align-items: center;` to the block container.

## 3. Included Items [easy]
The `itemIncluded` function did not work properly. There were 2 issues with it.

1. `typeof item === "boolean"` is not correct. The data set is of type object (Array), so I changed the first bit to `typeof item === "object"`.
2. `(item.included === "false")`, "false" is a string which will eq(true), thus true === false, which I changed to `(item.included === false)`.

## 4. Refactor [normal]
The packages.vue file is already pretty cleaned up with one outlier, the dataset.

So what I did is moved the data from `packages.vue` to `src/data/packageData.js` which I then reference with 
```
import packages from '../data/packageData'
...
data() {
  return {
    ...packages
  }
}
```
## 5. BONUS [hard]
This was a tough one. The initial response was to check the lazyLoad package since the `<lazy-component>` wraps the `<ImagePresenter>` component, as well as the issue being connected to page events.

So after some initial research, I came up with zero help. So my next step was to play around with the options used with the `VueLazyLoad` package.

Setting observer to true allowed for the component to work after scroll; however, it then ONLY worked after scroll. Not on initial load.
```
Vue.use(VueLazyload, {
  preLoad: 2,
  lazyComponent: true,
  observer: true,
});
```
So I did some debugging on the the components create, and click methods, and interestinlgly they both seem to "work" even though no data visually updates. 

This leads me to assume a few things.
1. The data isn't actually updating.
2. The data is constantly initiating causing the first thumbnail in the array to be infinitely selected.

But since setting `observer: true` sorta fixed #2, I would assume that it isn't the case. I didn't want to spend too much time on this part (like I already have), so I will just leave it at that. I would love to know the solution to this part.
